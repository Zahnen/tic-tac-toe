# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

Note: We don't want to leave you hanging, so please be aware that this prompt is more challenging than hangman. Stick with the first prompt if you are still getting the hang of Redux.

Create a React and Redux application that allows users to play tic-tac-toe. Begin by following this highly-recommended [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the React documentation that walks through the creation of a non-Redux tic-tac-toe game.

Even though you already know how to make non-Redux React apps, take your time and pay careful attention to each step of this tutorial. The tutorial includes shortcuts and pieces of functionality we haven't covered such as creating helper methods to dynamically render JSX.

Once you've successfully completed the tutorial, add Redux and React-Redux to your tic-tac-toe game and refactor the application to rely solely on Redux for all application state management.
